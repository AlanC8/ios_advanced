# Weather App

A modern iOS weather application built with SwiftUI that demonstrates the power of Swift's modern concurrency system. The app fetches multiple weather data points concurrently and displays them to the user as each one finishes loading.

## Features

- Current weather conditions
- 5-day weather forecast
- Air quality data
- Weather radar/map
- Weather alerts
- Concurrent data loading with loading indicators
- Error handling and retry functionality
- Pull to refresh
- Modern SwiftUI interface

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Swift 5.5+
- OpenWeatherMap API key

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `weather-app.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
4. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `WeatherService.swift` with your actual API key
5. Build and run the project

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Models**: Data models for weather information
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for displaying weather data
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Services**: API communication and data fetching

## Concurrency Implementation

The app uses Swift's modern concurrency features:

- `async/await` for asynchronous network calls
- `Task` for managing asynchronous operations
- `TaskGroup` for concurrent data fetching
- `@MainActor` for UI updates

## Error Handling

The app implements comprehensive error handling:

- Network error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality
- Loading states for each component

## Third-Party Dependencies

The app uses the following APIs:

- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- No additional third-party libraries are required

## Known Limitations

- Weather data is currently limited to the free tier of OpenWeatherMap API
- Weather map functionality might be limited based on API access
- Location search is not implemented in the current version

## Future Improvements

- Add location search functionality
- Implement data caching
- Add weather notifications
- Support for more weather data sources
- Detailed weather information views
- Weather widgets
